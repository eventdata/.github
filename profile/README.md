## Welcome to our data site of our NSF-funded event data work for LLMs and related work on real-time and historical event data. 

This is part of our projects titled "Modernizing Political Event Data for Big Data Social Science Research‚Äù and "Infrastructure For Political And Social Event Data Using Machine Learning" 

This project contributes to the computerized extraction of conflict event data at a global scale. Most conflict event data are expensively coded by humans from news reports. This project relies on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) to address that problem, and builds on earlier NSF efforts that created a publicly available large language model to study inter- and intra-state conflict, 

As an overview, our goals include: "Modern political conflict data are needed to understand the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of international relations and civil conflict. At present, we lack social science datasets with deep temporal and spatial coverages for events that affect regional, national, and international domains. Our proposal is to create event data on political and social events around the globe, with historical coverage, drawn from multiple language sources, and to make it freely available within hours of the events occurring. We will construct such an event dataset, along with the software and methodology needed to analyze the data."
